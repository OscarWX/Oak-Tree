# Context-Aware Feedback Update

## Problem
The system was providing math-specific feedback ("check your math!") even when students were learning about history, literature, or other non-mathematical subjects.

## Solution
Updated the `generateExampleFeedback` function in `app/api/chat/message/route.ts` to be context-aware based on the lesson topic.

## Changes Made

### 1. Function Signature Update
```typescript
// Before
function generateExampleFeedback(isValid: boolean, example?: string, concept?: string): string

// After  
function generateExampleFeedback(isValid: boolean, example?: string, concept?: string, topic?: string): string
```

### 2. Context Detection Logic
Added logic to detect if the topic is math-related:
```typescript
const isMathTopic = topic?.toLowerCase().includes('math') || 
                   topic?.toLowerCase().includes('algebra') || 
                   topic?.toLowerCase().includes('arithmetic') ||
                   topic?.toLowerCase().includes('geometry') ||
                   concept?.toLowerCase().includes('property') ||
                   concept?.toLowerCase().includes('equation')
```

### 3. Topic-Specific Feedback
- **Math Topics**: Include "check your math!" and mathematical validation
- **Non-Math Topics**: Use generic subject-appropriate language

### 4. Updated Function Calls
Updated both calls to `generateExampleFeedback` to pass the lesson topic:
```typescript
// For valid examples
const feedback = generateExampleFeedback(true, answer, currentQuestion.concept, session.lessons?.topic)

// For invalid examples  
const feedback = generateExampleFeedback(false, answer, currentQuestion.concept, session.lessons?.topic)
```

## Examples of Improved Feedback

### Math Topics (Algebra, Arithmetic, etc.)
- ❌ **Invalid Example**: "I see what you're thinking, but can you give me a clearer example? Remember to check your math!"
- ✅ **Valid Example**: "Excellent example! You really understand this concept!"

### History Topics
- ❌ **Invalid Example**: "I see what you're thinking, but can you give me a clearer example?"
- ✅ **Valid Example**: "Excellent example! You really understand this concept!"

### Literature Topics  
- ❌ **Invalid Example**: "Let's try again! Think about how this concept appears in everyday life or in the subject we're studying."
- ✅ **Valid Example**: "Fantastic! That shows you really grasp this concept!"

## Mathematical Error Handling
For topics that involve calculations, the system still provides specific mathematical feedback:
- Detects calculation errors in student examples
- Provides correct calculations
- Gives concept-specific guidance (e.g., associative property)

## Benefits
1. **Subject Appropriateness**: Feedback matches the academic subject
2. **Student Experience**: No confusing math references in history lessons
3. **Maintained Accuracy**: Math validation still works for mathematical concepts
4. **Minimal Changes**: Small, targeted update with maximum impact

## Testing
- Build completed successfully with no TypeScript errors
- Function maintains backward compatibility
- All existing functionality preserved
