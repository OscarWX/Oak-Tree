## For Students

### 1. Starting a Chat Session

1. **Navigate to your lesson** (your teacher will provide the link)
2. **Click "Start Chat"** to begin talking with Chirpy
3. **Wait for Chirpy's greeting** - they'll ask about the lesson topic

### 2. Meeting the AI Characters

#### Chirpy 🐦 (Orange Jay)
- **Role**: A fellow student who doesn't attend class
- **Personality**: Curious, friendly, wants to learn from you
- **What they do**: Ask questions about the lesson concepts
- **What they DON'T do**: Give you answers or act like a teacher

#### Sage 🦉 (Owl)
- **Role**: A wise helper who appears when needed
- **Personality**: Patient, supportive, knowledgeable
- **When they appear**: Only when Chirpy says "I don't follow that"
- **What they do**: Provide hints and gentle guidance

### 3. How to Have Effective Conversations

#### Teaching Chirpy
1. **Explain concepts clearly** as if teaching a friend
2. **Use examples** to help Chirpy understand
3. **Be patient** - Chirpy might not get it right away
4. **Try different explanations** if Chirpy seems confused

#### Example Conversation Flow:
```
Chirpy: "I heard in this lesson about addition you learned about carrying over. Can you teach me about it?"

You: "Sure! Carrying over happens when you add numbers and get more than 9 in a column. Like if you add 7 + 5, you get 12, so you write down 2 and carry the 1 to the next column."

Chirpy: "Oh that's interesting! Can you give me another example?"

You: "Of course! Let's try 28 + 15. First, 8 + 5 = 13. I write down 3 and carry the 1. Then 2 + 1 + 1 (the carried number) = 4. So the answer is 43!"

Chirpy: "That makes sense! So carrying is like moving extra to the next column?"
```

#### When Sage Appears:
```
Chirpy: "I don't follow that..."

Sage: "Let me help! Think about what happens when you have more than 10 of something. If you have 13 apples, how many groups of 10 can you make, and how many are left over?"

You: "Oh! I can make 1 group of 10, with 3 left over. So that's like the carrying - the 1 goes to the tens place!"
```

### 4. Understanding the Learning Process

#### What's Happening Behind the Scenes
- **Your explanations** help Chirpy learn (and help you reinforce your own understanding)
- **Sage's hints** guide you when you're stuck
- **The system tracks** which concepts you understand well and which need work
- **Your teacher sees** your progress and can help where needed

#### The Three Conversation Phases

**Phase 1: Concept Learning**
- Chirpy asks about specific lesson concepts
- You explain each concept as a teacher would
- Sage provides hints if you struggle

**Phase 2: Sage Help (if needed)**
- Happens when Chirpy doesn't understand your explanation
- Sage gives gentle hints to help you explain better
- You try explaining the concept again

**Phase 3: Open Chat**
- After covering all concepts, Chirpy asks "how's everything going?"
- Casual conversation about school, learning, etc.
- Builds relationship and reduces pressure

### 5. Tips for Success

#### Be a Good Teacher to Chirpy
- **Use simple language** that a peer would understand
- **Give concrete examples** from real life
- **Check if Chirpy understands** by asking "Does that make sense?"
- **Don't worry about being perfect** - learning is a process!

#### When You're Stuck
- **Wait for Sage** to appear with hints
- **Think about the hint** before responding
- **Ask yourself**: "How would I explain this to a friend?"
- **Use the hint** to guide your explanation

#### Making the Most of the Experience
- **Take your time** - there's no rush
- **Enjoy teaching** Chirpy new things
- **Learn from Sage's** different ways of explaining concepts
- **Celebrate** when Chirpy understands something you taught them!

### 6. What Your Teacher Sees

Your teacher can see:
- **How well you understand** each concept (but not your exact words)
- **Which topics** you find challenging
- **Your overall progress** in the lesson
- **When you last** completed a chat session

**Remember**: This isn't a test! It's a way for your teacher to help you learn better.

## Understanding the Analytics

### For Teachers: Reading the Data

#### Understanding Levels (1-4 Scale)
- **Level 1**: Severe misunderstanding - student needs significant help
- **Level 2**: Moderate misunderstanding - student needs clarification
- **Level 3**: Minor confusion - student mostly understands
- **Level 4**: Good understanding - student demonstrates mastery

#### Percentage Conversion
- **Level 1** = 25% understanding
- **Level 2** = 50% understanding  
- **Level 3** = 75% understanding
- **Level 4** = 100% understanding

#### Color Coding
- 🟢 **Green (80%+)**: Good understanding
- 🟡 **Yellow (60-79%)**: Moderate understanding
- 🟠 **Orange (<60%)**: Needs review

### For Students: What the System Tracks

The system automatically notices:
- **When you explain concepts clearly** (higher understanding levels)
- **When you struggle to explain** (lower understanding levels)
- **Which specific concepts** you find challenging
- **Your overall progress** through the lesson

**Important**: The system is designed to help, not judge. Lower levels just mean you need more practice!
