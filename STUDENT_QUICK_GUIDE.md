# OakTree Student Quick Guide

## 🐦 Meet Your AI Friends!

### Chirpy (Orange Jay)
- **Who**: A student who doesn't go to class
- **Wants**: To learn from YOU!
- **Says things like**: "Can you teach me about...?"
- **Never**: Gives you answers or acts like a teacher

### Sage (Owl)  
- **Who**: A wise helper
- **Appears when**: Chirpy says "I don't follow that"
- **Gives**: Helpful hints to guide you
- **Remember**: Sage is here to help, not judge!

## 🚀 How to Start
1. Click **"Start Chat"** on your lesson page
2. Wait for Chirpy to greet you and ask about the lesson
3. Start teaching Chirpy like you would help a friend!

## 💬 How to Chat Successfully

### ✅ Good Teaching Tips
- **Explain like to a friend** - use simple, clear words
- **Give examples** - "Like when you have 7 + 5..."
- **Be patient** - Chirpy might need you to explain differently
- **Use your own words** - don't just repeat what the textbook says

### 🤔 When You're Stuck
- **Wait for Sage** to appear with a hint
- **Read the hint carefully** and think about it
- **Try explaining again** using the hint
- **Don't worry** - this is normal and part of learning!

## 📚 The Three Parts of Chat

### Part 1: Teaching Time
- Chirpy asks about lesson concepts
- You explain each one clearly
- Sage helps if you get stuck

### Part 2: Getting Help (if needed)
- Happens when Chirpy doesn't understand
- Sage gives you hints
- You try explaining again

### Part 3: Friendly Chat
- After teaching, Chirpy asks "how's everything going?"
- Just casual conversation about school and life
- Have fun and relax!

## 🎯 Example Conversation

**Chirpy**: "I heard you learned about adding with carrying over. Can you teach me?"

**You**: "Sure! When you add numbers and get more than 9, you carry the extra to the next column. Like 7 + 5 = 12, so you write 2 and carry the 1."

**Chirpy**: "Oh interesting! Can you show me another example?"

**You**: "Of course! Let's try 28 + 15. First 8 + 5 = 13. Write down 3, carry the 1. Then 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. Answer is 43!"

**Chirpy**: "That makes sense! So carrying moves the extra to the next spot?"

## 🌟 Remember

### This is NOT a Test!
- You're **helping Chirpy learn**
- Your teacher wants to **help you** get better
- **Mistakes are okay** - that's how we learn
- **Take your time** - no rush!

### What Your Teacher Sees
- How well you understand concepts (not your exact words)
- Which topics you find challenging  
- When you completed the chat
- **Goal**: Help you learn better!

## 🆘 Need Help?

**Chirpy not responding?** → Check internet, try refreshing page
**Don't understand Sage's hint?** → Read it again slowly, ask your teacher
**Chirpy keeps saying "I don't follow"?** → Try explaining differently, use simpler words

## 🎉 Have Fun!
Remember: You're the teacher here! Enjoy helping Chirpy learn new things. Every time you explain something, you're getting better at understanding it yourself!
