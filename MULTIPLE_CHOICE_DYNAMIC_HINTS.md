# Multiple Choice Dynamic Hints System

## ‚úÖ **Enhanced Multiple Choice Experience**

The system now provides **intelligent, personalized hints** for multiple choice questions based on:
1. **Student's specific wrong answer**
2. **Number of attempts** (first vs second wrong answer)
3. **Context-aware feedback** that builds on their thinking

## üéØ **How It Works**

### **First Wrong Answer** ‚Üí Personalized Hint
When a student selects the wrong option for the first time:
- ‚úÖ **Analyzes their specific choice** using GPT-4
- ‚úÖ **Generates encouraging, personalized hint** 
- ‚úÖ **Builds on what they got right** (if anything)
- ‚úÖ **Guides toward correct thinking** without giving away the answer
- ‚úÖ **Allows retry** with the hint displayed

### **Second Wrong Answer** ‚Üí Direct Answer
When a student gets it wrong again:
- ‚úÖ **Provides the correct answer directly**
- ‚úÖ **Includes explanation** from the lesson
- ‚úÖ **Moves forward** (no more retries)

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Database Schema** (`database_multiple_choice_hints.sql`)

#### 1. **Multiple Choice Attempts Tracking**
```sql
CREATE TABLE multiple_choice_attempts (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  session_id UUID REFERENCES chat_sessions(id),
  student_id UUID REFERENCES students(id),
  lesson_id UUID REFERENCES lessons(id),
  concept TEXT NOT NULL,
  selected_option TEXT NOT NULL,
  correct_option TEXT NOT NULL,
  is_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  attempt_number INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### 2. **Enhanced Dynamic Hints Table**
```sql
-- Extended to support both example and multiple choice hints
ALTER TABLE dynamic_hints 
ADD COLUMN answer_type TEXT DEFAULT 'example' CHECK (answer_type IN ('example', 'multiple_choice'));

ALTER TABLE dynamic_hints 
ADD COLUMN attempt_number INTEGER DEFAULT 1;
```

#### 3. **Helper Functions**
```sql
-- Track multiple choice attempts
CREATE FUNCTION track_multiple_choice_attempt(...) RETURNS INTEGER;

-- Get attempt count for a concept
CREATE FUNCTION get_multiple_choice_attempt_count(...) RETURNS INTEGER;

-- Store enhanced dynamic hints
CREATE FUNCTION store_dynamic_hint_enhanced(...) RETURNS UUID;
```

### **Backend Logic** (`app/api/chat/message/route.ts`)

#### 1. **Attempt Tracking**
```typescript
const attemptNumber = await trackMultipleChoiceAttempt(
  sessionId,
  session.student_id,
  session.lesson_id,
  currentQuestion.concept,
  selectedOption,
  currentQuestion.correctOption,
  false
)
```

#### 2. **Dynamic Hint Generation**
```typescript
if (attemptNumber === 1) {
  // First wrong attempt - personalized hint
  const dynamicHint = await generateMultipleChoiceDynamicHint(
    selectedOption,
    currentQuestion,
    session.lessons?.topic || ''
  )
  
  feedback = "Not quite! Let me help you think about this."
  hint = cleanHintText(dynamicHint)
  
} else {
  // Second wrong attempt - direct answer
  feedback = "Let me help you with the correct answer."
  hint = `The correct answer is option ${currentQuestion.correctOption.toUpperCase()}: ${currentQuestion.options[currentQuestion.correctOption]}. ${currentQuestion.correctExplanation}`
}
```

#### 3. **GPT-4 Hint Generation**
```typescript
async function generateMultipleChoiceDynamicHint(
  selectedOption: string,
  question: any,
  topic: string
): Promise<string> {
  // Uses structured JSON prompt similar to example hints
  // Returns personalized hint based on specific wrong choice
}
```

## üé® **User Experience Examples**

### **Example 1: Economics - Supply and Demand**

**Question**: "What happens to price when demand increases and supply stays the same?"
- A) Price decreases
- B) Price increases ‚úÖ
- C) Price stays the same

**Student selects A** (Price decreases)

**First Attempt Response**:
```
ü¶â Sage: Not quite! Let me help you think about this.

üí° I can see why you might think that, but actually when demand increases, prices usually go up! Think about concert tickets - when more people want them, do they get cheaper or more expensive?
```

**If student selects A again**:
```
ü¶â Sage: Let me help you with the correct answer.

üí° The correct answer is option B: Price increases. When demand increases and supply stays the same, there are more people wanting the product than there are products available, so sellers can charge higher prices.
```

### **Example 2: History - Causes of WWI**

**Question**: "What was the immediate cause of World War I?"
- A) Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ‚úÖ
- B) German invasion of Belgium  
- C) Sinking of the Lusitania

**Student selects B** (German invasion of Belgium)

**First Attempt Response**:
```
ü¶â Sage: Not quite! Let me help you think about this.

üí° You're thinking of an important early event in the war! The German invasion of Belgium did happen, but that was after the war had already started. Think about what single event actually triggered all the countries to start fighting.
```

## üìä **Analytics and Insights**

### **Teacher Dashboard Data**
```sql
-- Multiple choice success rates by concept
SELECT * FROM multiple_choice_analytics WHERE lesson_id = 'lesson-uuid';

-- Results:
concept              | total_attempts | success_rate | avg_attempts_per_student
---------------------|----------------|--------------|------------------------
Supply and Demand    | 45             | 73.3%        | 1.4
Interrelatedness     | 38             | 65.8%        | 1.6
Market Failures      | 52             | 81.2%        | 1.2
```

### **Hint Effectiveness Analysis**
```sql
-- Compare hint types and effectiveness
SELECT * FROM comprehensive_hint_analytics 
WHERE answer_type = 'multiple_choice' 
ORDER BY avg_attempt_number DESC;
```
